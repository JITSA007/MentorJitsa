💡 About

DevSpark AI is an intelligent web application designed to help students, junior developers, and self-learners break out of "Tutorial Hell."

Instead of giving you generic project ideas like "To-Do List" or "Weather App," DevSpark acts as a Senior Software Architect. It analyzes your skill level, preferred tech stack, and domain interest to generate a unique, portfolio-worthy project blueprint complete with an implementation roadmap and business strategy.

"Code should save lives, not just crunch numbers." — Dr. Jitendra Prajapat

✨ Features

🧠 The AI Architect

Dynamic Idea Generation: Uses Google's Gemini AI to invent unique project concepts on the fly.

Smart Context Awareness: Tailors complexity based on whether you are a Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced developer.

Full Blueprint Output:

🏗️ Tech Stack: Best tools for the job.

🗺️ Roadmap: Step-by-step implementation guide (Markdown rendered).

💰 Monetization: Business models (SaaS, Freemium, etc.).

📄 Resume Points: Professional bullet points for your CV.

🤖 The "Mega-Prompt"

One-Click Tutor: Generates a highly detailed, 150+ word system prompt.

Copy & Paste: Paste this prompt into ChatGPT or Claude to get a personalized AI tutor that knows exactly what you are building and guides you through every step.

🛠️ System Resilience (Self-Healing)

Auto-Healing Engine: If the primary AI model fails (e.g., rate limit or API change), DevSpark automatically switches to backup models (Flash → Pro → 1.0) seamlessly.

Smart Retry: Handles quota limits with exponential backoff.

🎨 Next-Gen UI

3D Glassmorphism: A stunning interface that feels like it's floating in space.

Theme Engine: Toggle between "Cyberpunk Night" and "Frosty Day" modes.

Profile Integration: Features a dedicated section connecting users to Dr. Jitendra Prajapat for mentorship.

⚙️ How It Works

Input: You provide:

Tech Stack: (e.g., React, Python, Rust)

Domain: (e.g., SaaS, AI Tool, Blockchain)

Skill Level: (Beginner to Advanced)

Process: The app constructs a specialized prompt and sends it to the Gemini API via a secure, client-side call.

Output: The AI returns a structured JSON object containing the project title, description, roadmap, and tutor prompt.

Action: You get a full dashboard view of your new project, ready to build!
